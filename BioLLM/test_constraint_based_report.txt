# Constraint-Based Analysis of the *E. coli* Core Metabolic Model

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This constraint-based analysis of the *E. coli* core metabolic model (id: e_coli_core) provides a comprehensive understanding of the organism's central metabolism under various environmental and genetic perturbations. The model includes 95 reactions, 72 metabolites, and 137 genes, with a focus on glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) revealed an optimal growth rate of **0.8739 h⁻¹** under aerobic conditions with glucose as the sole carbon source. Several key reactions were identified as essential for growth, including those in glycolysis and the TCA cycle. Environmental stress simulations showed that the model is robust to changes in pH and temperature, although growth was reduced under basic pH and high-temperature conditions.

- **Growth Rate**: 0.8739 h⁻¹
- **Status**: Optimal
- **Key Uptakes**:
  - Glucose (EX_glc__D_e): -10.0 mmol/gDW/h
  - Oxygen (EX_o2_e): -21.799 mmol/gDW/h
  - Ammonium (EX_nh4_e): -4.765 mmol/gDW/h
- **Key Secretions**:

  - Protons (EX_h_e): 17.53 mmol/gDW/h

### 3.2 Carbon Source Utilization

The model was tested for growth on various carbon sources under aerobic conditions:

| Carbon Source | Growth Rate (h⁻¹) |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Glucose       | 0.8739            |
| Fructose      | 0.8739            |
| Acetate       | 0.1733            |
| Succinate     | 0.3976            |
| Lactate       | 0.0               |
| Glycerol      | 0.0               |
| Pyruvate      | 0.2912            |

Glucose and fructose supported maximal growth, while lactate and glycerol failed to support growth. Acetate and pyruvate supported intermediate growth, and succinate supported moderate growth.

### 3.3 Oxygen Dependency

Oxygen availability significantly influenced growth:

- **Aerobic Growth**: 0.8739 h⁻¹
- **Anaerobic Growth**: 0.2117 h⁻¹
- **Growth Reduction Under Anaerobiosis**: 75.78%

This indicates a strong dependence on oxidative phosphorylation for optimal biomass production.

### 3.4 Environmental Stress Responses

#### pH Analysis

| Condition       | Proton Exchange (mmol/gDW/h) | Growth Rate (h⁻¹) |
|----------------|------------------------------|-------------------|
| Acidic (pH 5)  | +10.0                        | 0.8739            |
| Neutral (pH 7) | 0.0                          | 0.8739            |
| Basic (pH 9)   | -10.0                        | 0.4985            |

The model maintained optimal growth under acidic and neutral pH but showed reduced growth under basic conditions.

#### Temperature Analysis

| Temperature | ATP Maintenance (mmol/gDW/h) | Growth Rate (h⁻¹) |
|-----------|------------------------------|-------------------|
| 20°C      | 5.0                          | 0.8912            |
| 37°C      | 8.39                         | 0.8739            |
| 45°C      | 15.0                         | 0.8403            |

Higher ATP maintenance costs at elevated temperatures led to a gradual decrease in growth rate.

### 3.5 Metabolic Network Robustness

A total of **16 reactions** were tested for essentiality via flux knockout analysis:

| Reaction | Wild-Type Flux | Knockout Growth Rate | Essential? |
|---------|----------------|----------------------|------------|
| GAPD    | 16.02          | 1.75e-16             | Yes        |
| PGK     | -16.02         | 0.0                  | Yes        |
| PGM     | -14.72         | 0.0                  | Yes        |
| ENO     | 14.72          | ~0.0                 | Yes        |
| CS      | 6.01           | ~0.0                 | Yes        |
| ICDHyr  | 6.01           | ~0.0                 | Yes        |

All six essential reactions belong to glycolysis and the TCA cycle, highlighting the importance of these pathways for biomass production. Other reactions such as PFK, FBA, and PYK were non-essential, indicating pathway redundancy or alternative routes.

## 6. Limitations and Future Directions

### Limitations:
- The e_coli_core model is a simplified representation and does not capture the full complexity of genome-scale metabolism.
- Environmental stress simulations are limited to pH and temperature; other factors such as osmolarity and nutrient limitation were not tested.
- Some carbon sources (e.g., lactate, glycerol) failed to support growth, which may be due to missing transporters or regulatory constraints.

### Future Directions:
- Expand the model to include regulatory constraints and gene expression data.
- Perform dynamic FBA (dFBA) to simulate time-dependent growth and substrate depletion.
- Extend environmental stress analysis to include osmotic stress and antibiotic exposure.
- Validate essential reactions experimentally using knockouts or CRISPRi.
