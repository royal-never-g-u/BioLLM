5. Sensitivity Analysis Results
Glucose Limitation Effects:

Linear relationship between glucose uptake and growth rate
Growth rate increases proportionally: 0.426 h⁻¹ at 5 mmol/gDW/h glucose to 2.231 h⁻¹ at 25 mmol/gDW/h
No apparent saturation within tested range
Oxygen Limitation Effects:

Growth becomes oxygen-limited below 30 mmol/gDW/h O₂ uptake
At 10 mmol/gDW/h O₂: growth rate reduced to 0.532 h⁻¹ (39% reduction)
Above 30 mmol/gDW/h O₂: no further growth improvement
Anaerobic Growth Capability:

Anaerobic growth rate: 0.158 h⁻¹ (82% reduction from aerobic)
Demonstrates fermentative capacity of E. coli
6. Gene Essentiality Analysis
Single gene knockout analysis revealed:

Essential genes identified: b1136 and b0720 (100% growth reduction)
Non-essential gene: b0008 and b2925 (no growth impact)
Partially essential gene: b0114 (2.14% growth reduction)
Metabolic Insights and Conclusions
1. Energy Metabolism Dominance
The analysis reveals that energy-generating reactions (ATP synthesis, electron transport chain) carry the highest fluxes, indicating that energy metabolism is the primary constraint for cellular growth under standard conditions.

2. Respiratory vs. Fermentative Metabolism
Aerobic respiration is highly efficient (0.877 h⁻¹ growth rate)
Fermentative pathways provide survival capability (0.158 h⁻¹) but at significantly reduced efficiency
Oxygen availability becomes limiting below 30 mmol/gDW/h uptake rate
3. Carbon and Nitrogen Utilization
The model demonstrates efficient utilization of glucose as the primary carbon source and ammonium as the nitrogen source, with optimal stoichiometric conversion to biomass components.

4. Transport and Regulation
Transport reactions account for the highest total flux burden (389.0 flux units), highlighting the importance of membrane transport processes in cellular metabolism.

5. Metabolic Flexibility
The linear response to glucose availability suggests that E. coli can efficiently scale metabolic activity with substrate availability, indicating robust regulatory mechanisms.

Experimental Validation Opportunities
Growth rate measurements under various glucose and oxygen concentrations
Metabolomic analysis to validate predicted flux distributions
Gene knockout experiments to confirm essentiality predictions
Respiratory quotient measurements to validate CO₂/O₂ exchange ratios
Limitations and Future Directions
Static analysis: FBA provides steady-state solutions and doesn't capture dynamic regulation
Gene regulation: Transcriptional and post-translational controls are not explicitly modeled
Enzyme kinetics: Kinetic constraints and metabolite concentrations are not considered
Spatial organization: Subcellular compartmentalization is simplified
